### About Me

- In 2022, I successfully graduated from the National Research University "Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology" with a degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering. During my studies, I gained practical experience in programming single-board computers and microcontrollers based on the ARM architecture. As part of my coursework, I implemented a processor based on the RISC-V architecture using Verilog. I also developed an "on-chip system," which gave me the opportunity to gain experience working with various interfaces such as VGA, PS/2, USB I2C, and SPI.
